# Hello there!
This is chompbot's repo. This is chompbots old version, and currently I am making a new version rewritten entirely. Even though this bot might suck, I'll list how to setup the bot. <br> 
<br>
## Step one: Getting your bot token 
First, to get your bot token you need to go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then you need to make an application. To do that, click the button in the top right corner and follow the steps. After you make your application, you need to make your bot. Just simply click the bot tab on the left side of your screen, and then click "Add Bot"<br>
<br>
Now that you have your bot, to get the bot token you need to click on the copy token button (or you can just reveal the token and copy it there.) ![Alt text](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697634291340804106/770335284998832128/unknown.png)<br>
<br> 
Remember, your bot token is sacred. Sharing it to anyone can make them have complete control over what your bot does. If that ever happens, just click regenerate token and it will make a new token for you.
